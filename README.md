# This is the code for Geometric Deep Learning course week2.

We provide code of LSTM, pretrained models, downstream works and learn from scratch models.

All the models were train on "real or fake dataset". https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nopdev/real-and-fake-news-dataset

Code for LSTM, pretrained models are shown in real_or_fake_using_lstm_bert.

We can achieve other pretrained models and downstream works by changing the huggingface pretrained models.

For learn from scratch models, the following tutorials are suggested.
